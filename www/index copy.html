                I'm trying to create my first website manually, and I have a few questions on how to do things. Please note I want to accomplish this in pure HTML5, no JS. All I have right now is a navigation header, which should stay fixed at the top of the page no matter how far one scrolls. However, in order to get an image to respect this header size, I've had to resort to using css in the following manner:

Is there a a more elegant way to accomplish this?
Additionally, is there a more relative way to accomplish spacing than using px? I know about rem for font, but is there anything similar for spacing? My reading indicates that retina screens honor a 2px conversion, but what about 4k screens?
